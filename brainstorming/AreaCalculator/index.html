    This tool is based on the idea that all areas need to be divided into triagles.
</p>
<p>
    Reson for this is that a triangle with known sides can only have one shape. The angles will always be the same.
    On the other hand, an area with more sides than 3 the shape can differ a lot depending on the angles of the corners.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine a perfect square compared with a recatngle with the same sides but squashed almost so it is flat.
    If that rectangle is defined by 2 triangles the shape will allways be only one exacly defined version.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine a component where you have some standard way of give the length of each of the side in a triangle and
    it spits out the area.
