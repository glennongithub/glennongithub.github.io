Resource. 
Also  still use this as a experiment to learn how to use jsdoc as a way to utilize typescript support especially in vscode.


Some helpfull resources I used to figure out how things work is:

The svelte source-code that now uses jsdoc in .js files instead of typescript.

I do not fully understand how and why the still rely on .d.ts files though. Which i do not think will work in pure js projects. 
But I ight need to verify/research that. 
I have so far managed to not use d.ts files but intesad proper @typedefs instead.
