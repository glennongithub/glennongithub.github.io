Resource. 
Also  still use this as a experiment to learn how to use jsdoc as a way to utilize typescript support especially in vscode.


Some helpfull resources I used to figure out how things work is:

https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html#template

The svelte source-code that now uses jsdoc in .js files instead of typescript. 
https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/tree/main/packages/svelte/src/store

I do not fullyinderstand how and why the still rely on .d.ts files though. Which i do not thingk will work in pure js projects. 
But I ight need to verify/research that. 
I have so far managed to not use d.ts files but intesad proper @typedefs instead.
